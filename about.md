Hi.

My name is Dave Morris. I am a `#{insert number of years since 1988}` year old professional Software Developer from Dublin, Ireland. My main area of expertise is frontend development, however, more and more I find myself veering to the ever fascinating world of Engineering Management.

I completeted my leaving cert in 2006, soon afterwards I began attending Dublin Institute of Technology where I spent four years earning my BSc in Business Computing. I've been working in the Software industry since I graduated in 2010. In my spare time I enjoy reading, writing, films, television, and music.

The point of this blog is two-fold - it is a platform to allow myself to solidify the lessons I've learned and will be forever learning, and, hopefully, a means to inspire those who need it. For the most part you'll find posts about the haman side of Software Development and how much Philosophy and Psychology intertwine with our day jobs. I do reserve the right, however, to write some technical posts if I so choose. I still want to keep my toes in the water :)

If you'd like to get in touch for any reason, my contact details are in the sidebar.

Enjoy the blog!
