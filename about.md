Hi.

So, I'm Dave. Dave Morris. I'm a Software Developer by trade, with a keen interest in people and how we all work. I'm also partial to film, books, writing, music and anything creative.

You'll find a healthy mix of Software and Philosophy on this blog, and mostly how the two relate together more than you might think.

If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch!
